## Introduction

This sketch demonstrates the MCCI Catena&reg; 4801 as a modbus master to collect data from a modbus device/meter and transmit using a LoRaWAN&reg;-techology network to transmit to a remote server.

The Catena 4801 is a single-board LoRaWAN-enabled modbus host.

Documents on the MCCI Catena 4801 are at https://github.com/mcci-catena/HW-Designs/tree/master/Boards/Catena-4801.

## Getting Started

In order to use this code, you must do several things:

1. Clone this repository into a suitable directory on your system.
2. Install the MCCI Arduino board support package (BSP).
3. Install the required Arduino libraries using `git`.
4. Build the sketch and download to your Catena 4801.

After you have loaded the firmware, you have to set up the Catena 4801.

This sketch uses the Catea-Arduino-Platform library to store critical information on the integrated FRAM. There are several kinds of information. Some things only have to be programmed once in the life of the board; other things must be programmed whenever you change network connections. Entering this information this involves entering Serial commands via the Arduino serial monitor.

- We call information about the 4801 that (theoretically) never changes "identity".
- We call information about the LoRaWAN "provisioning".

### Clone this repository into a suitable directory on your system

This is best done from a command line. You can use a number of techniques, but since you'll need a working git shell, we recommend using the command line.

On Windows, we strongly recommend use of "git bash", available from [git-scm.org](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Then use the "git bash" command line system that's installed by the download.

At the end of this process, you'll have a directory called `{somewhere}/Catena-Sketches`. You get to choose `{somewhere}`. Everyone has their own convention; the author typically has a directory in his home directory called `sandbox`, and then puts projects there.

Once you have a suitable command line open, you can enter the following commands. In the following, change `{somewhere}` to the directory path where you want to put `Catena-Sketches`.

```console
$ cd {somewhere}
$ git clone https://github.com/mcci-catena/Catena-Sketches

$ # get to the right subdirectory
$ cd Catena-Sketches/catena4801_simple

$ # confirm that you're in the right place.
$ ls
catena4801_simple.ino  git-repos.dat  README.md
```

### Install the MCCI STM32 board support library

Open the Arduino IDE. Go to `File>Preferences>Settings`. Add `https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-boards/raw/master/BoardManagerFiles/package_mcci_index.json` to the list in `Additional Boards Manager URLs`.

If you already have entries in that list, use a comma (`,`) to separate the entry you're adding from the entries that are already there.

Next, open the board manager. `Tools>Board:...`, and get up to the top of the menu that pops out -- it will give you a list of boards. Search for `MCCI` in the search box and select `MCCI Catena STM32 Boards`. An `[Install]` button will appear to the right; click it.

Then go to `Tools>Board:...` and scroll to the bottom. You should see `MCCI Catena 4801`; select that.

### Select your desired band

When you select a board, the default LoRaWAN region is set to US-915, which is used in North America and much of South America. If you're elsewhere, you need to select your target region. You can do it in the IDE:

![Select Bandplan](../extra/assets/select-band-plan.gif)

As the animation shows, use `Tools>LoRaWAN Region...` and choose the appropriate entry from the menu.

### Select the Serial interface

When you select a board, the default Serial interface is set to `Generic serial`, which only uses first hardware serial of Catena 4801. The RS-485 module in Catena uses the second hardware serial for modbus(RTU) communication. As this sketch uses RS-485 communication, it is necessary to select `Two HW Serial` in Serial interface.

### Installing the required libraries

This sketch uses modbus library.

The script [`git-boot.sh`](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Catena-Sketches/blob/master/git-boot.sh) in the top directory of this repo will get all the things you need.

It's easy to run, provided you're on Windows, macOS, or Linux, and provided you have `git` installed. We tested on Windows with git bash from https://git-scm.org, on macOS 10.11.3 with the git and bash shipped by Apple, and on Ubuntu 16.0.4 LTS (64-bit) with the built-in bash and git from `apt-get install git`.

```console
$ cd Catena-Sketches/catena4801_simple
$ ../git-boot.sh

#### List of required libraries

This sketch depends on the following libraries.

*  https://github.com/mcci-catena/Catena-Arduino-Platform
*  https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lorawan
*  https://github.com/mcci-catena/Catena-mcciadk
*  https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lmic
*  https://github.com/mcci-catena/MCCI_FRAM_I2C
*  https://github.com/mcci-catena/Modbus-for-Arduino

### Build and Download

Shutdown the Arduino IDE and restart it, just in case.

Ensure selected board is 'MCCI Catena 4801' (in the GUI, check that `Tools`>`Board "..."` says `"MCCI Catena 4801"`.

In the IDE, use File>Open to load the `catena4801_simple.ino` sketch. (Remember, in step 1 you cloned `Catena-Sketches` -- find that, and navigate to `{somewhere}/Catena-Sketches/catena4801_simple/`)

Follow normal Arduino IDE procedures to build the sketch: `Sketch`>`Verify/Compile`. If there are no errors, go to the next step.

### Configure Modbus parameters

To communicate with the Modbus slave, it is necessary to modify the Modbus slave parameter in the `setup_modbus` function as it matches the device parameters.

```
/* Modbus slave parameters */
u8addr = 65;			// current target device: 65
u8fct = 03;			// Function code
u16RegAdd = 00;			// start address in device
u16CoilsNo = 13;		// number of elements (coils or registers) to read
host.begin(&mySerial, 9600);	// baud-rate at 9600
```

Connect your modbus slaves A and B terminal to Catena 4801s A and B terminal (JP3).

### Load the sketch into the Catena

Make sure the correct port is selected in `Tools`>`Port`.

Load the sketch into the Catena using `Sketch`>`Upload` and move on to provisioning.

## Provision your Catena 4801

In order to provision the Catena, refer the following document: [How-To-Provision-Your-Catena-Device](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Catena-Sketches/blob/master/extra/How-To-Provision-Your-Catena-Device.md).

## Notes

### Setting up ST-Link connection

Catena 4801 uses ST-Link V2 programmer for programming the firmware. Below is the connection between 4801 and ST-Link programmer
