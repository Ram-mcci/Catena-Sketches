# Catena 4410 Test01 Sketch

This sketch is used for the Ithaca power project and other AC power management applications. It's also a great starting point for doing Catena 4410 work. Because of the portability features of the [Catena-Arduino-Platform](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Catena-Arduino-Platform) library. And also this sketch demonstrates the MCCI Catena&reg; 4410 as a remote temperature/humidity/light/water/soil sensor.

In order to use this code, you must do several things:

1. Clone this repository into a suitable directory on your system.
2. Install the MCCI BSP package.
3. Install the required Arduino libraries using `git`.
4. Build and download.
5. "Provision" your Catena 4410 -- this involves entering USB commands via the Arduino serial monitor to program essential identity information into the Catena 4410, so it can join the targeted network.

## Clone this repository into a suitable directory on your system

This is best done from a command line. You can use a number of techniques, but since you'll need a working git shell, we recommend using the command line.

On Windows, we strongly recommend use of "git bash", available from [git-scm.org](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Then use the "git bash" command line system that's installed by the download.

At the end of this process, you'll have a directory called `{somewhere}/Catena-Sketches`. You get to choose `{somewhere}`. Everyone has their own convention; the author typically has a directory in his home directory called `sandbox`, and then puts projects there.

Once you have a suitable command line open, you can enter the following commands. In the following, change `{somewhere}` to the directory path where you want to put `Catena-Sketches`.

```console
$ cd {somewhere}
$ git clone https://github.com/mcci-catena/Catena-Sketches

$ ls

```

## Install the MCCI SAMD board support library

Open the Arduino IDE. Go to `File>Preferences>Settings`. Add `https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-boards/raw/master/BoardManagerFiles/package_mcci_index.json` to the list in `Additional Boards Manager URLs`.

If you already have entries in that list, use a comma (`,`) to separate the entry you're adding from the entries that are already there.

Next, open the board manager. `Tools>Board:...`, and get up to the top of the menu that pops out -- it will give you a list of boards. Search for `MCCI` in the search box and select `MCCI Catena SAMD Boards`. An `[Install]` button will appear to the right; click it.

Then go to `Tools>Board:...` and scroll to the bottom. You should see `MCCI Catena 4410`; select that.

## Select your desired band

When you select a board, the default LoRaWAN region is set to US-915, which is used in North America and much of South America. If you're elsewhere, you need to select your target region. You can do it in the IDE:

![Select Bandplan](./assets/menu-region.gif)

As the animation shows, use `Tools>LoRaWAN Region...` and choose the appropriate entry from the menu.

## Installing the required libraries

This sketch uses several sensor libraries.

The script [`git-boot.sh`](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Catena-Sketches/blob/master/git-boot.sh) in the top directory of this repo will get all the things you need.

It's easy to run, provided you're on Windows, macOS, or Linux, and provided you have `git` installed. We tested on Windows with git bash from [https://git-scm.org](https://git-scm.org), on macOS 10.11.3 with the git and bash shipped by Apple, and on Ubuntu 16.0.4 LTS (64-bit) with the built-in bash and git from `apt-get install git`.

==== Summary =====

It has a number of advanced options; use `../git-boot.sh -h` to get help, or look at the source code [here](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Catena-Sketches/blob/master/git-boot.sh).

**Beware of issue #18**.  If you happen to already have libraries installed with the same names as any of the libraries in `git-repos.dat`, `git-boot.sh` will silently use the versions of the library that you already have installed. (We hope to soon fix this to at least tell you that you have a problem.)

### List of required libraries

This sketch depends on the following libraries.

* [github.com/mcci-catena/Adafruit_BME280_Library](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Adafruit_BME280_Library)
* [github.com/mcci-catena/Adafruit_Sensor](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Adafruit_Sensor)
* [github.com/mcci-catena/Adafruit_TSL2561](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Adafruit_TSL2561)

## Build and Download

Shutdown the Arduino IDE and restart it, just in case.

Ensure selected board is 'MCCI Catena 4410' (in the GUI, check that `Tools`>`Board "..."` says `"MCCI Catena 4410"`.

In the IDE, use File>Open to load the `catena4410_test01.ino` sketch. (Remember, in step 1 you cloned `Catena-Sketches` -- find that, and navigate to `{somewhere}/Catena-Sketches/catena4410_test01/`)

Follow normal Arduino IDE procedures to build the sketch: `Sketch`>`Verify/Compile`. If there are no errors, go to the next step.

## Load the sketch into the Catena

Make sure the correct port is selected in `Tools`>`Port`.

Load the sketch into the Catena using `Sketch`>`Upload` and move on to provisioning.

## Provision your Catena 4410

In order to provision the Catena, refer the following document: [How-To-Provision-Your-Catena-Device](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Catena-Sketches/blob/master/extra/How-To-Provision-Your-Catena-Device.md).

## Notes

### gitboot.sh and the other sketches

The sketches in other directories in this tree are for engineering use at MCCI. The `git-repos.dat` file in this directory does not necessarily install all the required libraries needed for building the other directories. However, all the libraries should be available from [github.com/mcci-catena](https://github.com/mcci-catena/); and we are working on getting `git-repos.dat` files in every sub-directory.
